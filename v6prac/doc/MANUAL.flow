NAME
====
    flow, packet.cgi - packet flow create tool


SYNOPSIS
========
    flow [-Inw] [-h [-C|i]] [-N|a|m] [-c|d <file_name>] [file_name]

    packet.cgi time [file]


DESCRIPTION
===========
    HTML option
        -C, HTML output with CGI
                input must be specific file with absolute path
        -h, HTML output
        -i, HTML output with CGI, interactive mode

    flow option
        -N, don't show any flow
        -a, show ip flow with mac flow
        -m, show only mac address flow

    define option
        -c, create define file
        -d, define sort order, alias, color

    other option
        -I, show identifier packets
        -n, numeric output only
        -w, show TCP window

    This program "flow" inputs output of packet analyzer "pa". And creates
    packet flow chart.
    Default input is stdin.

    CGI program "packet.cgi" are used only when
    you run flow with h option.


RETURN VALUES
=============
    The program exits with zero on success, non-zero on failures.


PLATFORM
========
    FreeBSD + KAME


INNER FUNCTION
==============
    The program contains three automatic function as inner function.

(1) Automatic sort
    "flow" makes appeared addresses sort mathematically and automatically.
    For exception, Unspecified Address.

(2) Automatic alias
    "flow" makes appeared multicast addresses aliases automatically.
    "flow" supports all addresses which are described in RFC 2375.

    REFERENCE

        RFC 2375 - IPv6 Multicast Address Assignments

(3) Automatic coloring
    "flow" colors special packets automatically.

        red - Router Solicitation
            - Router Advertisement
            - Neighbor Solicitation
            - Neighbor Advertisement

        green - Destination Unreachable
              - Packet Too Big
              - Time Exceeded
              - Parameter Problem
              - Redirect

        blue - TCP which URG flag is set
             - TCP which RST flag is set
             - TCP which SYN flag is set
             - TCP which FIN flag is set

        orange - Neighbor Advertisement which Solicited flag is not set


SUPPORT PROTOCOL
================
    This program "flow" supports only "IPv6" and "IPv4".
    Other protocol aren't supported.


SIMPLE USAGE
============
    Most simple use is following.

        # tcpdump -i interface -s 4096 -w tcpdump_file
        $ pa -b tcpdump_file | flow

    If you want to filter by using "pa", use is following.

        $ pa tcpdump_file | tee pa.txt
        $ flow pa.txt


HTML OUTPUT
===========
    HTML files of packet flow chart are 3 HTML files (body.html, flow.html, and
    footer.html). And "flow" makes this 3 HTML files.

        body.html - packet flow itself
        footer.html - sub information

        flow.html - frame outline
                    This frame contains "body.html" and "footer.html".

    Then, you can see packet flow chart, when you open "flow.html" by your www
    browser.


CGI
===

packet.cgi
    This CGI extract a output of "pa" for one packet which contains inputted
    time.

    It is usually placed $(document root)/cgi-bin/ directory.

    And, This CGI is called from "body.html".

    EXAMPLE
        $ packet.cgi 18:47:08.084534 pa.txt
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Content-type: text/plain

        1999/08/31 18:47:08.084534
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        Frame_Ether                     (length:70)
        | Hdr_Ether                       (length:14)
        | | DestinationAddress               = 33:33:0:0:0:1
        | | SourceAddress                    = 0:0:f4:35:78:a2
        | | Type                             = 34525
        | Packet_IPv6                     (length:56)
        | | Hdr_IPv6                        (length:40)
        | | | Version                          = 6
        | | | TrafficClass                     = 0
        | | | FlowLabel                        = 0


CREATE HTML OUTPUT
==================
    First, you must prepare "packet.cgi".

    If cgi-bin directory, which "packet.cgi" is installed, is
    $(document root)/cgi-bin/, simply, add option "h", and option "p", if you
    need.

        $ flow -h -c $(SOMEWHERE)pa.txt
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    In "body.html", link to CGI is below.

        ...<A HREF="/cgi-bin/packet.cgi?18:32:16.352142+$(SOMEWHERE)pa.txt"...
                                                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If cgi-bin directory is other directory, add option "i".
    For example, path of "packet.cgi" is ~/public_html/cgi-bin/packet.cgi, and
    path of output of "pa" is ~/public_html/data/pa.txt.

        $ flow -h -i pa.txt

    Then, "flow" asks you path to "packet.cgi" and path to output of "pa".

        ENTER CGI PATH  > ../cgi-bin/packet.cgi
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        ENTER FILE PATH > ../data/pa.txt
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    In body.html, link to CGI is below.

        ...<A HREF="../cgi-bin/packet.cgi?18:32:16.352142+../data/pa.txt"...
                    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~                 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    If you don't want to use CGI, type below.

        $ flow -h pa.txt


DEFINE FILE
===========
    If you want to modify output, use define file.

    First, run "flow" with option "-c". This option makes a template define
    file.

        $ flow -c define.txt pa.txt

    Then, you edit this "define.txt" by text editor.

        syntax)
            ip [IP address] [alias name] [HTML color]
            mac [MAC address] [HTML color]

        example)
            ip  [fe80::200:f4ff:fe5c:e287] [link-local address] [FFD700]
            ip  [10.21.0.195]              [ ]                  [FFD700]

            mac [00:00:f4:5c:e2:87] [FFD700]

    And apply this define file to flow.

        $ flow -d define.txt pa.txt
