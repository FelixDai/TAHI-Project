Project Overview
================

TAHI Project is the joint effort formed with the objective of
developing and providing the verification technology for IPv6. 

The growth process of IPv4 was the history of encountering various kinds of
obstacles and conquering such obstacles. However, once the position as
infrastructure was established, it is not allowed to repeat the same history.
This is a reason why the verification technology is essential for IPv6
deployment.

	We research and develop conformance tests and interoperability tests
	for IPv6.

	We closely work with the KAME project.
	We help activities of the KAME project in the quality side by offering
	the verification technology we develop in TAHI project and improve
	the development efficiency. 

	We open the results and fruits of the project to the public for FREE.
	Any developer concerned with IPv6 can utilize the results and fruits
	of TAHI project freely. A free software plays an important role in
	progress of the	Internet. We believe that providing the verification
	technology for FREE contributes to advances of IPv6. Besides the
	programs, the specifications and criteria of verification will be
	included in the Package.


Organizations
=============

TAHI Project is a 1.5 year (hopefully longer) project 
(October 1, 1998 - March 21, 2000). The project is formed by the following
organizations (in alphabetical order):
	The University of Tokyo 
	YDC Corp. 
	Yokogawa Electric Corp. 


Introduction of IPv6 Interoperability Test Tool
==========================================
The IPv6 Interoperability Test Tool is a tool package to help your 
Interoperability tests for IPv6.

That is, with the Tool, you can

	- analyze the packets captured by tcpdump.
		program name is "pa"

		For more detail about pa, see the manual MANUAL.pa.

	- generate any traffic.
		program name is "tg"

		For more detail about tg, see the manual MANUAL.tg.

	- use some utilities
		- IPv6 UDP echo program
			program name is "echo6"

		- ICMP generate program
			program name is "icmpg"

		- IPv6 Multicast program
			program name is "mcast6"

		- IPv6 Routing Protocol Packet Analyze Tool
			program name is "rpdump"

TAHI project also offers you another package for IPv6 interoperability test
programs that are developed based on the Tool. 

	- flow
		You can make packet flow with program "flow".
		flow works with pa, it reads output file of pa and 
		draw a packet flow, that is browsable. 

	- packet.cgi
		In case you don't want to make many files, packet.cgi is 
		helpful.
		It displays the packet you specified dynamically.
		If you want use this, you should use flow without "-C" or "-i" option.

	- pareport.pl
		You can make packet report with perl script "pareport.pl".
		pareport works with pa, it reads output file of pa and 
		report packet information, that is browsable. 
	
	For more detail about flow, packet.cgi, pareport.pl,
	see the manual in doc directory.

	We are developing another tool that works with pa.
