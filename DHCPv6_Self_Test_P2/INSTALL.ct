Terminology
===========

    Tester Node (TN)
        A tester node for the conformance tests.

    Node Under Test (NUT)
        A testee node for the conformance tests.

    Network Under Test
        The network where the conformance tests are executed.

    Tester Interface
        The network interface of TN
        hooked up to the Network Under Test.

    Interface Under Test
        The network interface of NUT
        hooked up to the Network Under Test.

    Client
        A node that initiates requests on a link to abtain configuration
        parameters from one or more DHCP server.

    Server
        A node that responds to requests from clients, and may or may
        not be on the same link as the client(s).

    Relay Agent
        A node that acts as an intermediary to deliver DHCP messages 
        between clients and servers, and is on the same link as the
        client.


Prerequisites
=============

    Prerequisites for TN:

        - The package supports
           FreeBSD/i386 6.4-RELEASE or higher

        - It is mandatory to install IPv6 Conformance Test Platform
          "v6eval" that is also developped by TAHI project.
          For more information,
          please refer to 00README.v6eval (in v6eval package).


Installing the package onto TN
==============================

    1. Before Starting

        Make sure that you completed installing "v6eval" package.
        Please refer to INSTALL.v6eval (in v6eval package) for more
        information.

    2. Extracting ct package

        $ tar zxvf DHCPv6_Self_Test_X-X-X.tgz



Configuration
============

    1. Physical Configurations

    1.1. Network Under Test

        Hook up the Tester Interface of TN to the Network Under Test.
        Tester Interface of TN can be configured for IPv4 and for IPv6
        as well.

        Hook up the Interface Under Test of NUT to the Network Under
        Test.
        Interface Under Test of NUT must be configured for IPv6, while
        it can be configured for IPv4 too.

        Make sure that any other nodes are not hooked up to the network
        because their packets would disturb the conformance tests.

            Example: (If NUT is a client or a server device)

                TN                      NUT
                 |the Tester I/F: ed1    |the I/F Under Test: fxp0
                 |                       |
                 |                       |
                -+-----------------------+- Link0
                  the Network Under Test

            Example: (If NUT is relay agent)

                -+-----------------------+- Link1
                 |                       |
                 |                       |
                 |the Tester I/F: ed2    |the I/F Under Test: fxp1
                 TN                     NUT
                 |the Tester I/F: ed1    |the I/F Under Test: fxp0
                 |                       |
                 |                       |
                -+-----------------------+- Link0
                 the Network Under Test

        more specific Network configurations are described in
        00README of each directory respectively.

    1.2. Physical wiring image

            Example: (If NUT is a client or a server device)

                 TN (tester)                       NUT (client or sever)
                +------------+ Ether cross cable  +------------+
                |       [ed1]+--------------------+[fxp0]      |
                +------------+                    +------------+

            Example: (If NUT is a relay agent)

                 TN (tester)                       NUT (relay agent)
                +------------+ Ether cross cable  +------------+
                |       [ed2]+--------------------+[fxp1]      |

                +------------+                    +------------+

    
    2. Configuration of NUT

    2.1. Basic Configuration of NUT

    2.1.1. Host (if NUT is a Server and a Client)
    
        - one network interface used in testing, must be 'up' status.
          And NUT have Link Local Address based on EUI64 (MAC address
          base).

        - turn on IPv6 supporting.

        - If NUT is Server which cannot be assigned a Global Address by
          RA, NUT must have following Global Address.

            Link0 : 3ffe:501:ffff:100: + EUI64 (MAC address base)

        - remove any other configurations.
          like as DNS setting, IPv6 default route, static IPv6 routing,
          etc...

        more specific configurations may be described in
        00README of each directory respectively.

    2.1.2. Router (If NUT is a Relay Agent, a Requesting Router
                   or a Delegating Douter)

        - two network interfaces used in testing, must be 'up' status.
          And NUT have two Link Local Address based on EUI64 (MAC
          address base).
          And NUT have following two Global Address.

            Link0 : 3ffe:501:ffff:100: + EUI64 (MAC address base)
            Link1 : 3ffe:501:ffff:101: + EUI64 (MAC address base)

        - turn on IPv6 supporting.

        - turn on IPv6 packet forwarding.

        - remove any other configurations.
          like as DNS setting, IPv6 default route, static IPv6 routing,
          etc...

        - turn off any kind of routing daemon
          which packets would disturb the tests.

        more specific configurations may be described in
        00README of each directory respectively.

    2.2. Example (FreeBSD/i386 6.1-RELEASE)

    2.2.1. /etc/resolv.conf

        Remove /etc/resolv.conf to prevent NUT from issuing unnecessary
        packets that would disturb the tests.

    2.2.2. Default route

        It is recommended to remove IPv4 default route,
        though it is not mandatory.

    2.2.3. /etc/rc.conf

        If NUT is a client or a server,
        you need the following configuration.

            Example: /etc/rc.conf
            ==========================================================
            ipv6_enable="YES"
            ifconfig_fxp0="up"
            ipv6_network_interfaces="fxp0"
            ipv6_default_interface="fxp0"
            ==========================================================

        If NUT is a Relay agent, you need more modification to rc.conf.

            Important points:

                - turn off any kind of routing daemon
                  which packets would disturb the tests.

                - Assign a prefix "3ffe:501:ffff:100/64" and
                  "3ffe:501:ffff:101/64" to Interfaces Under Test.

            Example: /etc/rc.conf
            ==========================================================
            ipv6_enable="YES"
            ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"
            ifconfig_fxp0="up"
            ifconfig_fxp1="up"
            ipv6_network_interfaces="fxp0 fxp1"
            ipv6_default_interface="fxp0"
            ipv6_prefix_fxp0="3ffe:501:ffff:100"
            ipv6_prefix_fxp1="3ffe:501:ffff:101"
            ==========================================================

    3. Configuration of TN

        First, please read INSTALL.v6eval (in v6eval package).

    3.1. /etc/resolv.conf

        It is recommended to remove /etc/resolv.conf,
        though it is not mandatory.

    3.2. Default route

        It is recommended to remove IPv4 default route,
        though it is not mandatory.

    3.3. Installing perl-related modules

        The package requires the below-listed perl5 modules.

            - Digest-HMAC

        you can install them from the package's ports directory.

            # (cd /usr/ports/security/p5-Digest-HMAC && make install)

    3.4. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def

        Copy sample tn.def to tn.def.
        Then, adjust Link0 and Link1 entry in the file.

            # cd /usr/local/v6eval/etc
            # cp tn.def.sample tn.def
            # vi tn.def

                "Link0" entry MUST have:
                    - the EXACT name of Tester Interface.
                    - a BOGUS MAC address.
                      It is important that the Tool can impersonate
                      other nodes.

                "Link1" entries are required for a Relay agent test.

            Example: /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
            ==========================================================
            RemoteDevice    cuad0
            RemoteDebug     0
            RemoteIntDebug  0
            RemoteLog       1
            RemoteSpeed     0
            RemoteLogout    0
            RemoteMethod    serial
            Link0   ed1     00:00:00:00:01:00
            ==========================================================
            If NUT is a Relay agent, you need to specify also Link1.

    3.5. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def

        Copy sample nut.def to nut.def.
        Then, adjust Link0 and Link1 entry in the file.

            # cd /usr/local/v6eval/etc
            # cp nut.def.sample nut.def
            # vi nut.def

                "HostName" entry SHOULD be a host name of NUT.

                "Type" entry MUST be:
                    - "host" if NUT is configured as a host.
                    - "router" if NUT is configured as a router.

                "Link0" entry MUST have:
                    - the EXACT name of the Interface Under Test.
                    - the EXACT MAC address of the Interface Under Test.

                "Link1" entries are required only for a router test.

            Example: (If NUT is a client or server)
            ==========================================================
            System          manual 
            TargetName      FreeBSD/i386 6.1-RELEASE
            HostName        target.tahi.org
            Type            host
            User            root
            Password        v6eval
            Link0   fxp0    00:90:27:14:ce:da
            ==========================================================

            Example: (If NUT is a relay agent)
            ==========================================================
            System          manual 
            TargetName      FreeBSD/i386 6.1-RELEASE
            HostName        target.tahi.org
            Type            router
            User            root
            Password        v6eval
            Link0   fxp0    00:90:27:14:ce:da
            Link1   fxp1    00:90:27:14:ce:db
            ==========================================================

    3.6. adjust test parameter

        Some of test can adjust it's test parameter.
        More information may be described in
        00README of each directory respectively.


Run the Tests
=============

        $ cd $SOMEWHERE/DHCPv6_Self_Test_X-X-X

    first of all, If you run the tests,
    you have to install remote files to /usr/local/v6eval/bin/manual/.

	# make install

    You have to config advanced functionalities status and test
    configurations
        $ vi config.txt
            
        Advanced functionalities (Main threee function)
            "Address_assignment" parameter is:
                - zero:     NUT does not support addrss assignment in RFC 3315
                - non-zero: NUT supports

            "DNS_configuration" parameter is:
                - zero:     NUT does not support DNS configuration options
                - non-zero: NUT supports

            "Stateless_DHCPv6" parameter is:
                - zero:     NUT does not support stateless DHCPv6
                - non-zero: NUT supports.

            "Prefix_Delegation" parameter is:
                - zero:     NUT does not support IPv6 prefix options
                - non-zero: NUT supports

            The relationship between these parameters corresponds to each
            sections of the test specification published by IPv6 Ready
            Committee as described below.

        Configuraiton of NUT
            "Support_DUID_LLT", "Support_DUID_EN" and "Support_DUID_LL"
            parameters are:
                - zero:     NUT does not support that DUID type
                - non-zero: NUT supports.

                * Since these parameters are exclusive parameters,
                  You must choose one DUID corresponding to your actual
                  implementation before starting the test.

                  - When Support_DUID_LLT is turned on,
                    Test DHCP_CONF.1.1.5 Part A and PartB will be
                    performed.

                  - When Support_DUID_EN is turned on,
                    Test DHCP_CONF.1.1.5 Part C and PartD will be
                    performed.

                  - When Support_DUID_LL is turned on,
                    Test DHCP_CONF.1.1.5 Part E and PartF will be
                    performed.

        Configuraiton of TN
            "Send_Initial_RA" parameter is:
                - zero:     NUT does not use RA for initialization
                - non-zero: NUT use RA for initialization

        Configuraiton of NUT(If NUT is a server)
            "$Support_Listen_LLA" and "$Support_Listen_GA" parameters are:
                - zero:     NUT does not support that listening DHCPv6 message on link local address.
                - non-zero: NUT supports.

    To run the test

    $ make clean

        IPv6 Ready Logo Test Program Phase-2 DHCPv6 Protocols
        --------------------------------------------------------
            (If NUT is a client)
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_client

            (If NUT is a server)
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_server

            (If NUT is a relay agent)
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_relay

            (If NUT is a requesting router)
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_requesting_router
                or
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_client

            (If NUT is a delegating router)
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_delegating_router
                or
            $ make ipv6ready_p2_server

    When TN need you to operate on NUT, TN will show you the message
    which describes How to operate NUT.
    Then you can operate NUT as descrbed by the message.
    When all tests are completed,
    you can see the test results at
    ${SOMEWHERE}/DHCPv6_Self_Test_X-X-X/index.html.

    Note that running the tests clears the previous test results.
    If you do not want to lose them,
    you should make a new copy of Self_Test package in a different
    directory.


Q&A : Have a problem?
=====================
    Q: How am I supposed to do, when TN show me following Error message.

        can't open bpf or socket

    A: Please check your TN's bpf configuration.
        ensure bpf devices to have read permission, and see
        INSTALL.v6eval

            Example:
                $ ls -l /dev/bpf*

        ensure network interfaces to have 'up' status,
        and see INSTALL.v6eval and INSTALL.ct
            Example: (If Link0 name is ed0, and Link1 name is ed1)

                $ ifconfig ed0 ed1

        unix domain socket may be remaind in /tmp
