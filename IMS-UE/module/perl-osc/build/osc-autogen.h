/* This header defines simple perlapi-ish macros for creating SV wrappers
 * and extracting the GPerl value from SV wrappers.  These macros are used
 * by the autogenerated typemaps, and are defined here so that you can use
 * the same logic anywhere in your code (e.g., if you handle the argument
 * stack by hand instead of using the typemap). */
