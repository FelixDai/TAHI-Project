Project Overview
================

    TAHI Project is the joint effort formed with the objective of
    developing and providing the verification technology for IPv6.

    The growth process of IPv4 was the history of encountering
    various kinds of obstacles and conquering such obstacles.
    However, once the position as infrastructure was established,
    it is not allowed to repeat the same history.
    This is a reason why the verification technology is essential for IPv6
    deployment.

        We research and develop conformance tests and interoperability tests
        for IPv6.

        We closely work with the KAME project and USAGI project.
        We help activities of these projects in the quality side by offering
        the verification technology we develop in TAHI project and improve
        the development efficiency.

        We open the results and fruits of the project to the public for FREE.
        Any developer concerned with IPv6 can utilize the results and fruits
        of TAHI project freely. A free software plays an important role
        in progress of the Internet. We believe that providing the
        verification technology for FREE contributes to advances of IPv6.
        Besides the programs, the specifications and criteria of verification
        will be included in the Package.
