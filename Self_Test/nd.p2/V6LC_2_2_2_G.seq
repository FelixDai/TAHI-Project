=head1 Procedure

  Part G: Valid Router Advertisement, Unicast Destination
   25. Reboot the HUT.
   26. Wait until the HUT transmits a Router Solicitation.
   27. TR1 transmits Router Advertisement A with a Source Link-layer Address Option. The Source 
       Address is the link-local address of TR1. The Hop Limit is 255. The ICMP Code is 0. The 
       ICMP Checksum is valid. The destination address is the HUT's link-local address.
   28. Wait RTR_SOLICITATION_INTERVAL + MAX_RTR_SOLICITATION_DELAY

=head1 Observable Results

  Parts G
   The HUT should transmit only one Router Solicitation. The Router Solicitation should be sent from 
   either the link-local address of the HUT or the unspecified address. The destination address should 
   be the AllRouters multicast address. The Router Solicitation may or may not include a Source i
   Link-layer Address option.   


=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
