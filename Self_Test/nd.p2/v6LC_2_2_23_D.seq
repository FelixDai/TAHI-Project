=head1 Procedure

  Part D
   10. TR1 transmits a Router Advertisement A.
   11. TR2 advertises Router Advertisement B with Route Information Option with the following information:
	Length: 3
	Prefix Length: 96
	PRF: High
	Lifetime: 30 seconds
	Prefix:2001:2:0:2000:0:1::

   12. TR1 forwards an Echo Request from TN2 with a source address of 3ffe:501:ffff:102::2 to the NUT. 


=head1 Observable Results

   Steps 12:
   The NUT should respond to the Echo Request with an Echo Reply with a next-hop of TR2.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
