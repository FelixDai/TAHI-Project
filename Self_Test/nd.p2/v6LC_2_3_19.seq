=head1 Procedure

   1. TR1 forwards an Echo Request to the HUT. 
   2. TR1 transmits a Redirect message and Redirect Fragment to the HUT. 
   3. TR1 forwards an Echo Request to the HUT. 

=head1 Observable Results

   Step 1:
   The HUT should respond to the Echo Request using TR1 as a first hop.
   Step 3:
   The HUT should respond to the Echo Request using TR1 as a first hop.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
