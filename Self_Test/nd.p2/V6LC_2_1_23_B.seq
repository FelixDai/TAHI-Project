=head1 NAME

  Test v6LC.2.1.23 - Fragment Header in Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisement
  Part B: Neighbor Advertisement with Fragment Header

=head1 Purpose
  Verify that the NUT doesn't process Neighbor Soliciation and Neighbor Advertisement messages with fragments.

=head1 References

  * [RFC-6980] - Section 5

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. If the NUT is a router, configure a default route
  with TR1 as next hop. The Common Test Cleanup is performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part B: Neighbor Advertisement with Fragment Header 
   3. TN1 transmits an Echo Request to the DUT.
   4. TN1 transmits Neighbor Advertisment and NA Fragment.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part B
   Step 3:
    Observe the NUT transmitting a Neighbor Solicitation for TN1.
   Step 4:
    The NUT should not transmit an Echo Reply indicating that it did not process the fragmented Neighbor Advertisement.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
