   Verify that the NUT doesn't process Router Soliciation and Router Advertisment messages with atomic fragments.

=head1 References

  * [RFC-6980] -  Section 5

=head1 Resource Requirements

=head1 Procedure

  Part B: Router Soliciation with Atomic Fragment (Router Only)
   3. TN1 transmits Router Solicitation B.
   4. TN1 transmits an Echo Request to the RUT.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part B
   Step 4:
     Observe the NUT transmitting a Neighbor Soliciation indicating that it didn¡¯t process the Router Soliticaiton.
     The NUT must not transmit an Echo Reply.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
