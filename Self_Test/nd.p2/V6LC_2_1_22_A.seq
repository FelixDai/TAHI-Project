=head1 NAME

  Test v6LC.2.1.22 - Atomic Fragments in Neighbor Soliciation and Neighbor Advertisment
  Part A: Neighbor Soliciation with Atomic Fragment

=head1 Purpose

   Verify that the NUT doesn't process Neighbor Solicitations or Neighbor Advertisements messages with atomic fragments.

=head1 References

  * [RFC-6980] - Section 5

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. If the NUT is a router, configure a default route
  with TR1 as next hop. The Common Test Cleanup is performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part A: Neighbor Soliciation with Atomic Fragment
   1. TN1  transmits Neighbor Soliciation.
   2. TN1 transmits an Echo Request to the NUT.

=head1 Observable Results

  Part A
   Step 2:
    Observe the NUT transmitting a Neighbor Soliciation indicating that it didn't process the Neighbor Soliticaiton.   
    The NUT must not transmit an Echo Reply.

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
