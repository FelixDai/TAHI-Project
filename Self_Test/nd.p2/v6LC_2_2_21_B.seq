=head1 NAME

  Test v6LC.2.2.21 - Transmitting Route Information Option (Routers Only)
  Part B: Route Information Option with Prefix Length less than 64

=head1 Purpose

  Verify that the RUT transmit a Router Information Option in Router Advertisements.

=head1 References

  * [RFC-4191]  Section 2.3

=head1 Resource Requirements

  * Packet generator
  * Monitor to capture packets

=head1 Test Setup

  No Common Test Setup is performed. The Common Test Cleanup procedure is
  performed after each part.

=head1 Procedure

  Part B: Route Information Option with Prefix Length less than 64
  2. Configure the RUT to advertise Route Information Option on interface A with following
     Prefix 3ffe:601:ffff:102::/32 with a lifetime of 600 seconds and PRF set to medium.


=head1 Observable Results

  Part B
    Step 2:
      Observe the RUT transmitting a Router Advertisement with a properly formatted Route Information Option that includes:
	Type = 24
	Length = 2 or 3
	Resvd = zero.
	Route Lifetime = 600 seconds
	Prefix Length = 32
	PRF= Low
 

=head1 Possible Problems

  * None.
