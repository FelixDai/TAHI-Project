  Reassembly_Overlap - Overlapping Fragments
  Part F - Reverse Order Fragments (Global)  

=head1 TARGET

  None

=head1 TEST PROCEDURE

Verify that a node correctly reassembles fragmented packets and distinguishes between packet fragments using the Source Address, Destination Address and Fragment ID.

  9. TN1 transmits Fragments A.3, A.2, and A.1 in that order.   A2. and A.3 have overlapping payloads..

        Payload
            data               = 32 octets from the head of ICMP Echo request

  Echo Request Data (2nd fragment) is:

        Payload
            data               = 32 octets from the back of ICMP Echo request


=head1 JUDGEMENT

  PASS: The NUT must discard the fragments and must not transmit an Echo Reply or Error message.

=head1 CLEANUP

# =head1 REFERENCE
# 
# RFC8200
# 
# 4.5  Fragment Header
# 
#   o If any of the fragments being reassembled overlap with any
#     other fragments being reassembled for the same packet,
#     reassembly of that packet must be abandoned and all the
#     fragments that have been received for that packet must be
#     discarded, and no ICMP error messages should be sent.
#     It should be noted that fragments may be duplicated in the
#     network. Instead of treating these exact duplicate fragments
#     as overlapping fragments, an implementation may choose to
#     detect this case and drop exact duplicate fragments while
#     keeping the other fragments belonging to the same packet.
