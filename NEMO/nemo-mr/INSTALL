	Installing IPv6 Conformance Test Package


Terminology
===========

Tester Node (TN)
	A tester node for the conformance tests.

Node Under Test (NUT)
	A testee node for the conformance tests.

Network Under Test
	The network where the conformance tests are executed.

Tester Interface
	The network interface of TN
	hooked up to the Network Under Test.

Interface Under Test
	The network interface of NUT
	hooked up to the Network Under Test.


Prerequisites
=============

Prerequisites for TN:
	- The package supports
		FreeBSD 5.X-RELEASE
		FreeBSD 6.X-RELEASE
	- Software Requirements (FreeBSD Ports) 
		lang/p5-Expect
		security/p5-Digest-MD5
	- The package can also coexist with FreeBSD version of KAME.
	- It is mandatory to install IPv6 Conformance Test Platform
	  "v6eval" that is also written by TAHI project. For more
	  information, please refer to 00README.v6eval in "v6eval".


Installing the package onto TN
==============================

0. Before Starting

   Make sure that you completed installing "v6eval" package.
   Please refer to 00README.v6eval in "v6eval" for more information.

1. Extracting ct package

	% tar zxvf ct-nemo-mr-X.X.X.tar.gz

2. Installing ct package

	% cd ct-nemo-mr-X.X.X
	% su
	# make install

   With the above steps, you can install ct package into
   /usr/local/v6eval/ct-nemo-mr directory.
   Be sure not to run the tests within this directory.

3. Copying ct package
   Copy ct directory to any directory you like.
	% cp -pR /usr/local/v6eval/ct-nemo-mr $SOMEWHERE/ct-nemo-mr
	% chmod -R +w $SOMEWHERE/ct-nemo-mr

Note)
   The ike module is always necessary, even if you don't use IKE.


Configuration
============

1. Physical Configurations

1.1. Network Under Test

Hook up the Tester Interface of TN to the Network Under Test.
Tester Interface of TN can be configured for IPv4 and for IPv6 as well.

Hook up the Interface Under Test of NUT to the Network Under Test.
Interface Under Test of NUT must be configured for IPv6, while it can
be configured for IPv4 too.

Make sure that any other nodes are not hooked up to the network
because their packets would disturb the conformance tests.

		TN			NUT
		 |the Tester I/f: ed1	 |the I/f Under Test: fxp0
		 |			 |
		 |			 |
		-+-----------------------+- Link0 (the Home Link)
		  the Network Under Test

		 |the Tester I/f: ed2	 |the I/f Under Test: fxp1
		 |			 |
		 |			 |
		-+-----------------------+- Link1 (the Mobile Network)
		  the Network Under Test

1.2. Serial line

Connect both COM ports of TN and NUT with
a Null-modem cable (or a RS232C cross cable).

	Example:

	   COM1            COM1
	TN --------------------	NUT
	        serial line
	       (Null-modem cable)

The following Null-modem cable is required to connect TN and NUT
if a cable is DSUB-9 pins.

	1 DCD ********** open ********* 1 DCD

	2 RXD ------------------------- 3 TXD
	3 TXD ------------------------- 2 RSD

	4 DTR ------------------------- 6 DSR
	6 DSR ------------------------- 4 DTR

	5 GND ------------------------- 5 GND

	7 RTS ------------------------- 8 CTS
	8 CTS ------------------------- 7 RTS

	9 CE  ********** open ********* 9 CE

For details, please read "Serial Communications" of the handbook of FreeBSD:
	http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/



2. Configuration of NUT (example)

2.1. FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE w/ KAME

2.1.1. /etc/resolv.conf

Remove /etc/resolv.conf to prevent NUT from issuing unnecessary packets
that would disturb the tests.


2.1.2. Default route

It is recommended to remove IPv4 default route, though it is not mandatory.


2.1.3. Account of the super user

It is set as a prerequisite for NUT that TN has the following account:

	- user-name: root
	- password: v6eval
	- login shell: /bin/csh
	- prompt: #


2.1.4. /etc/rc.conf

If NUT is a host, at least, you must need the following line to rc.conf.

		ipv6_enable="YES"

	Example: /etc/rc.conf
	==========================================================
	ipv6_enable="YES"
	ipv6_network_interfaces="fxp0"
	ipv6_default_interface="fxp0"
	==========================================================

If NUT is a router, you need more modification to rc.conf.

Important points:
	- Do not run any kind of routing daemon
	  which packets would disturb the tests.

	- Assign a prefix "3ffe:501:ffff:100/64" and "3ffe:501:ffff:101/64" 
	  on Interface Under Test.

	Example: /etc/rc.conf
	==========================================================
	ipv6_enable="YES"
	ipv6_default_interface="fxp0"
	ipv6_gateway_enable="YES"
	ipv6_network_interfaces="fxp0 fxp1"
	ipv6_prefix_fxp0="3ffe:501:ffff:100"
	ipv6_prefix_fxp1="3ffe:501:ffff:101"
	rtadvd_enable="NO"
	==========================================================

2.1.5. /etc/ttys

TN requires you to log into NUT as a super user.
To log into NUT, modify /etc/ttys.

	Example: /etc/ttys
	==========================================================
	--- ttys.orig   Fri Oct 12 13:32:01 2001
	+++ ttys        Fri Oct 12 13:32:54 2001
	@@ -42,6 +42,7 @@
	 ttyv8  "/usr/X11R6/bin/xdm -nodaemon"  xterm   off secure
	 # Serial terminals
	 # The 'dialup' keyword identifies dialin lines to login, fingerd etc.
	+cuaa0  "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   unknown on  secure

	 ttyd1  "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   dialup  off secure
	 ttyd2  "/usr/libexec/getty std.9600"   dialup  off secure
	==========================================================

NOTE:	The cuaa* drivers are safer than the ttyd* drivers
	because the cuaa* drivers can work with a Null-modem cable
	that drops CD signals.

	For more information, please read "Serial Communications"
	of the handbook of FreeBSD:
		http://www.freebsd.org/handbook/


2.1.6. kernel configuration

If you want to execute IPsec test,
you need to re-compile the kernel.

3. Configuration of TN

3.1. /etc/resolv.conf

It is recommended to remove /etc/resolv.conf, though it is not mandatory.

3.2. Default route

It is recommended to remove IPv4 default route, though it is not mandatory.

3.3. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def

You can copy any entry except "Link0" from the sample file.

/usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def.sample.

	"Link0" entry MUST have:
		- the EXACT name of Tester Interface.
		- a BOGUS MAC address.
		  It is important that the Tool can impersonate other nodes.

	Example: /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def
	==========================================================
	RemoteDevice    cuaa0 # USB-serial may use ucom0
	RemoteDebug     0
	RemoteIntDebug  0
	RemoteLog       0
	RemoteSpeed	0
	RemoteLogout	0
	RemoteMethod	serial
	Link0   ed1     00:00:00:00:01:00
	Link1   ed2     00:00:00:00:01:00
	==========================================================

3.4. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def

You can copy both "System" and "TargetName" from the sample file
/usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def.sample.

	"HostName" entry SHOULD be a host name of NUT.

	"Type" entry MUST be:
		- "host" if NUT is configured as a host.
		- "router" if NUT is configured as a router.

	"User" entry MUST be a name of a super user account of NUT.

	"Password" entry MUST be a password of a super user account of
	NUT.

	"Link0" entry MUST have:
		- the EXACT name of the Interface Under Test.
		- the EXACT MAC address of the Interface Under Test.

	Example: /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def
	==========================================================
	System          kame-freebsd
	TargetName      FreeBSD 4.8-RELEASE + kame-20030616-freebsd48-snap
	HostName        target.v6pc.jp
	Type            host
	User            root
	Password        v6eval
	Link0           fxp0    00:90:27:14:ce:da
	Link1           fxp1    00:90:27:14:ce:db
	==========================================================

3.5. cu command

To run cu command, set up the following.

	# touch /var/log/aculog
	# chmod a+rw /var/log/aculog

HINT: /etc/fbtab is another way to adjust file permission.

The package uses "/dev/cuaa0" as the default line name 
(see /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def).
If TN requires a different line name, modify the following files,
depending on the setups of your machine:

	- /etc/remote or else
	- "RemoteDevice" entry in /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def

DIAG:	If "cu" related customization is not properly performed,
	the following command can not be executed successfully:

		%cu -l /dev/cuaa0
		user: root
		password: v6eval
		root@NUT#

 	If /usr/local/v6eval/etc/{nut,tn}.def is not correct,
	the following command can not be executed successfully.

		%/usr/local/v6eval/bin/kame-freebsd/loginout.rmt -o1


Run the Tests
=============

	% cd $SOMEWHERE/ct-nemo-mr/nemo-mr
	% vi config.txt
	% make clean
	% make test

It will take a few hours to run the tests. When all tests are completed,
you can see the test results at $SOMEWHERE/ct-nemo-mr/index.html.

Note that running the tests clears the previous test results.
If you do not want to lose them, you should make a new copy of ct package
in a different directory.

HINT:	To see the test results with Netscape, follow the next steps:
	1. Register application in Netscape:
		MIME Type: application/x-tcpdump
		Extension: dump
		Action/Application: ethereal -r %s
