                             (Remote control line)



Remote control system
=====================

1. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/tn.def

   You can set up the TN's device for remote control.

2. /usr/local/v6eval/etc/nut.def and the directory for romote files.

   You can describe the remote control for NUT in remote files.  The
   description depends on the implementation.  Therefore, the directory
   that stores remote files is independently prepared by each system.

   Default Remote files is in below. 

      /use/local/v6eval/bin/manual/

   System entry in nut.def has meant this directory.

      ==========================================================
      System          manual
      ==========================================================

   You can create other system name and the corresponding directory.

      /use/local/v6eval/bin/XXX/

      ==========================================================
      System          XXX
      ==========================================================

Note)
   We do not support about the remote files of your system. Some similar
   samples may be able to be found with the package of remote files.



Remote files
============

   Remote files necessary to this test tool is the following.  You should
   describe the following operations.

   The start operation sequence of test item is either of the two types.
   It is whether it reboots. The call of remote files has a difference.

   (A) When rebooting, remote files are called in following order.

      1. mldv2DisableRUT.rmt

         It is an opportunity which stops MLDv2 function under behavior.
         If the disabling is impossible, for example by clearing information,
         cause an initial sequence at the opportunity of enabling.

      2. mldv2SetRUT.rmt

         It is an opportunity which sets up the variable to NUT. Variables
         are given to a remote file as arguments. Depending on implementation,
         command execution can be made or a configuration file can be described.

      3. reboot.rmt

         It is an opportunity which reboots NUT.

      4. mldv2EnableRUT.rmt

         It is an opportunity which enables MLDv2 function.

   (B) When not rebooting, remote files are called in following order.

        1. mldv2DisableRUT.rmt

        2. mldv2SetRUT.rmt

        3. mldv2EnableRUT.rmt



Results Backup
==============

   Note that running the tests clears the previous test results.
   If you do not want to lose them, you should make a new copy of ct-X
   package in a different directory.

   The method of simple backup of only result files.
   Note: Simple backup is not enough as corroborative data to IPv6 Ready Logo.

   To back up test results.
      $ cd $SOMEWHERE/ct-mldv2-router-X.X.X/mldv2-router_2in1
      $ result_bkup.sh XXX

   Test results are copied to new directory.
      ./RESULT/XXX_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS

   To make simple report.html through the XXX directorys.
      $ result_index.sh XXX

      ./RESULT/XXX_report.html

# EOF
